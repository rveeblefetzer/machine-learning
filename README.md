##Working with Imperfect Data
Analyzing data from Philadelphia's Police Advisory Commission, on [complaints against police, 2009-2012](https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/philadelphia-police-advisory-commission-complaints/resource/3b4abb69-a1ba-4dea-8e37-bb43829629e8).

I chose the data set because Philadelphia has had a long history of complaints about police abuse and corruption. After decades of complaints and pressure from City Council, the city's citizen Police Advisory Commission was established in 1993 by Mayor Ed Rendell ([pdf link](http://www.phila.gov/pac/PDF/Exec_Order_893.pdf)) as a civilian oversight board. The external panel convenes regularly and submits recommendations to the mayor, police commissioner and managing director. Many, however, complain that the body is underfunded and toothless. Human Rights Watch noted that support for the board is seen as being anti-police, and said in a [report](https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports98/police/uspo110.htm) that the panel remains in a contentious relationship with the city's police union, the Fraternal Order of Police, which has sued the citizen oversight board. Still, the board is one way for citizens to log complaints that might be dismissed by other police, as well as a way to notify a third party of the reported incident.
